# This file ensures the datasets directory exists in the repository
# while keeping all dataset files ignored by git.
#
# Dataset files are typically large and should not be committed to git.
# Instead, they should be:
# - Downloaded using the provided scripts
# - Stored locally for development and testing
# - Uploaded to S3 or other cloud storage for distribution
